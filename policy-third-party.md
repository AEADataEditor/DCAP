Policy and Protocol on Third-Party Verifications
================================================

This protocol describes how third parties can, at the request of the AEA
Data Editor, conduct a reproducibility check.

Alternate protocols are possible, but should be verified with the AEA
Data Editor prior to engaging any resources.

#### Preliminaries

-   The author(s) should provide a complete and exhaustive archive,
    ready for publication, to the AEA Data Editor.
    -   The archive does not need to be public at this stage, as long as
        it can be shared privately.
    -   The archive does not have to contain the data necessary for the
        reproducibility check if data is confidential or proprietary.
        However, the archive must contain a publishable description of
        how an independent researcher can access the data ("data
        availability statement") once all conditions for access have
        been met.
-   The AEA Data Editor will verify the archive.
    -   Aside from the data itself, all other materials specified in the
        [Data and Code Availability
        Policy](dcap2020.md), such as data
        citations, must be included.

#### What or Who Is a Third-Party Replicator

The third-party replicator is a person not affiliated with the AEA
editorial offices who has access to the (public-use, confidential or
restricted) data used in the author\'s paper, and who

-   has not been involved with the author\'s research project
-   has disclosed any conflicts of interest
-   promises to conduct an arms-length reproducibility exercise with no
    direct interaction with the author (other than to undertake specific
    steps to access the data)

#### Steps for the Third-Party Replicator

-   Download the author\'s replication archive(s) from the location
    provided by the AEA Data Editor (public or privately shared).
    -   Do not obtain any code or instructions directly from the author.
-   Ensure access to any confidential files that are described in the
    replication archive\'s README.
    -   Consider whether a person not familiar with the precise data
        environment could reasonably find and access the data, based
        solely on the instructions in the README.
-   Follow the
    [checklist](https://social-science-data-editors.github.io/guidance/Verification_guidance.html)
    to conduct the reproducibility exercise, relying exclusively on the
    README for instructions and guidance.
-   Write a
    [report](https://github.com/AEADataEditor/replication-template/blob/master/REPLICATION.md).
-   Send the report to the AEA Data Editor.
-   Report any interactions with the author in the course of conducting
    the reproducibility exercise (help, assistance, clarifications).
